# Help and Support

## General Information

Ghostty is described as "a personal side project with no commercial backing," meaning there is no dedicated support team. However, the community is noted as being helpful and responsive to questions.

## Common Issues & Solutions

The help page includes a troubleshooting table addressing five frequent problems:

1. **Terminal compatibility errors** → Terminfo documentation
2. **macOS window manager conflicts** (Yabai, Aerospace) → macOS Tiling Window Managers guide
3. **Linux performance issues** → GTK Single Instance configuration
4. **OpenGL errors on Linux** → GTK OpenGL Context troubleshooting
5. **Shell configuration on macOS** → macOS Login Shells documentation

## Getting Assistance

Two primary community resources are available:

- **GitHub Discussions**: For searching answers and asking questions from the community
- **Discord**: Real-time community chat (community-moderated)

## Reporting Issues

The project emphasizes reading the contributing guide before submitting feedback. Importantly, bug reports and feature requests should begin as discussions on GitHub Discussions rather than direct GitHub Issues, which are only created after "more specific details are known."
