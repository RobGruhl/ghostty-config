# Terminal API (VT) Overview

## Purpose
The Terminal API (VT) documentation provides APIs for developers creating applications within Ghostty. It covers how programs use control sequences to interact with the terminal.

## Core Concepts

**Control Sequences Defined:**
"Programs running in terminals use control sequences to interact with the terminal. Control sequences are a series of special characters that the terminal interprets as commands."

These are also known as "VT sequences" or "escape codes."

## Documentation Structure

The Terminal API section includes:

1. **Overview** - Current page with general information
2. **Reference** - Full list of supported sequences
3. **Concepts** - Conceptual foundations covering:
   - Control Sequences
   - Cursor behavior
   - Screen management

4. **Control** - Basic control characters (BS, BEL, CR, LF, TAB)
5. **ESC** - Escape sequence commands (8 variations)
6. **CSI** - Control Sequence Introducer commands (31+ variations)

## Key Navigation

The documentation directs users to the reference page for a comprehensive sequence list and the concepts page for foundational understanding of how control sequences operate.
